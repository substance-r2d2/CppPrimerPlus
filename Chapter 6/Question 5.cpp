/*5. The Kingdom of Neutronia, where the unit of currency is the tvarp, has the following
income tax code:
First 5,000 tvarps: 0% tax
Next 10,000 tvarps: 10% tax
Next 20,000 tvarps: 15% tax
Tvarps after 35,000: 20% tax
For example, someone earning 38,000 tvarps would owe 5,000 × 0.00 + 10,000 ×
0.10 + 20,000 × 0.15 + 3,000 × 0.20, or 4,600 tvarps.Write a program that uses a
loop to solicit incomes and to report tax owed.The loop should terminate when
the user enters a negative number or non-numeric input.*/
